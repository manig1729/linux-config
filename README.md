# Linux config files

These are my config files : bashrc, vimrc and a few i3wm config files which I have added here so it serves as a backup and also to be used while switching machines.

The programs needed to make these work and the locations of the files are mentioned in each of the files separately. Note that i3-config and i3status-config are not the actual names of those files - they are both called "config"
